*Python is a programming language that can be used for many purposes. It has a clear, readable syntax and uses significant indentation to indicate code blocks. Python is dynamically-typed and uses a garbage collector.*

*Learn the basics of [Appium testing on the LambdaTest platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-appium-testing/).*

## Python With Appium

This article will guide you in getting started with configuring and running your Python-based Appium automation test scripts on the **LambdaTest Real Device Cloud Platform**.

## Objective

1.  Set up an environment for testing your Apps using **Python** with **Appium**.
2.  Understand and configure the core capabilities required for your Appium test suite.
3.  Explore the advanced features of LambdaTest.

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing App automation testing with Appium, you would need to follow these steps:

- Install the latest Python build from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend using the latest version.
- Make sure **pip** is installed in your system. You can install **pip** from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### Clone The Sample Project

**Step-1:** Clone the LambdaTestâ€™s [LT-appium-python](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Python-UnitTest-Selenium) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python
cd LT-appium-python
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/).

**Step-2:** Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

  {`export LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" \\
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}"
  
**For Windows:**

  {`set LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" \
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}"
 
### Upload Your Application

**Step-3:** Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

**Linux/macOS:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" \\
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \\
--form 'name="Android_App"' \\
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' 
`}

**Windows:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""`}

**Using App URL:**

**Linux/macOS:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" \\
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \\
--form 'name="Android_App"' \\
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"'`}

**For Windows:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -d "{\"url\":\"https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk\",\"name\":\"sample.apk\"}"`}

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

## Run Your First Test

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Python test on LambdaTest.

Test Scenario: Check out [Android.py](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python/blob/master/android.py) file to view the sample test script for android and [iOS.py](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python/blob/master/ios.py) for iOS.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

**Step-4:** You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios-config" label="iOS" default>

```python title="iOS(.ipa)"
 desired_caps = {
    "deviceName":"iPhone 12",
    "platformName":"ios",
    "platformVersion":"14",
    "isRealMobile":True,
    "app":"YOUR_APP_URL",
    "build":"Python Vanilla iOS",
    "name":"Sample Test - Python",
    "network":True,
    "visual":True,
    "video":True
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android-config" label="Android" default>

```python title="Android(.apk)"
desired_caps = {
    "deviceName":"Galaxy S20",
    "platformName":"Android",
    "platformVersion":"10",
    "app":"YOUR_APP_URL",
    "isRealMobile":True,
    "build":"Python Vanilla Android",
    "name":"Sample Test - Python",
    "network":True,
    "visual":True,
    "video":True
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Info Note:**

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/beta/index.html)**. A more Detailed Capability Guide is available [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/).

### Executing The Tests

**Step-5:** Run the following command in the directory where your project has been saved to execute your build.

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

```bash
python3 ios.py
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>

```bash
python3 android.py
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
